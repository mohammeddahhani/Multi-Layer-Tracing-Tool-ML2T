# Introduction
ML2T is a multi-layer tracing tool to analyse data exchange (unidirectional TCP connexion) over a wirelss link at both the TCP and MAC layer on the same graph. 

# Requirement
Our tool requires a valid capture file which can produced using `tcpdump`. Monitor mode is required to capture data.

The capture file should start with a TCP data segment, excluding TCP handshake segments (i.e. syn, syn-ack, ack)
This can be done by using wireshark build-in filtering: 
- For example, if the starting TCP segment is captured at t = 49.1 seconds, `frame.time_relative >= 49.1` extracts all the trafic starting t= 49.1 s.
- Use `file -> Export specified Packets ...` to save the resulting filtered trafic to a new file.

# Usage
Use `./extract capture.pcap` to extract necessary information from the pcap file.

For plotting:
- `python plot.py --h`
- `python plot.py --encap-segs` to plot mac frames and their associated block ack that encapsulate TCP segments
- or `python plot.py --encap-acks` to plot mac frames and their associated block ack that encapsulate TCP acks

The following variables in `plot.py` can be used to shift the TCP or MAC traffic in order to have one close to the other:
- `tcp_shift`
- `mac_shift`
- `mac_scale`

# Folder's description
ML2T take as an input a pre-processed tcpdump capture (.pcap) to produces a set of data which can be used -- e.g. using python -- to create a Time/Sequence plot.

Files and folders relevent to how ML2T works are described bellow:

- __./tcp_sender__: Contains two capture files, one for block acks frames and the other one for packets sent by the TCP sender. The string version of each pcap files is also given

- __./tcp_receiver__: Contains two capture files, one for block acks frames and the other one for packets sent by the TCP receiver. The string version of each pcap files is also given

- __./sequences__: Contains MAC sequence numbers of all data frames sent by both the sender and receiver (frame_tcpxxx.seq), MAC sequence numbers and the content of the bitmap of block acks sent by both TCP sender and receiver (back_tcpxxx.seq) and finally the TCP sequence numbers of TCP sender segments (seg_tcpsnd.seq) and TCP receiver acks (ack_tcprcv.seq) 

- __./extractors__: a set of scripts that use the string version of the captures in ./tcp_sender and ./tcp_receiver to extract sequences at the MAC and TCP layer and store them in the ./sequence folder

# Limitations
For now, only uniderectional TCP traffic is supported since a biderectionnal trafic is messy to visualize on the same graph.
In case the captured TCP trafic is bidirectionnal, one could extract 2 unidirectional trafics, one in each direction, using wireshark build-in regex then apply 
our tool.

By default only IEEE 802.11ad strafic is supported. This can be improved by changing hex values that identify specific IEEE 802.11 frame types (see `extract.sh`).
Here is a non-exhaustive list of MAC ids (on-going work):
- __IEEE 802.11ad__:
  - data frames: `wlan[0:1]==0x88`
  - block acks: `wlan[0:1] == 0x94 && wlan[16:1] == 0x05`
- __IEEE 802.11ac__:
  - data frames: 
  - block acks: 
- __IEEE 802.11n__:
  - data frames: 
  - block acks:   
- __IEEE 802.11a__:
  - data frames: 
  - acks: 
- __IEEE 802.11b__:
  - data frames: 
  - acks: 

Another limitation is the `moduloToLinear()` function in `plot.py`. 
More robust linear transformations should be added.
